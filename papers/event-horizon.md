### **Mathematical Formalism for a Homomorphic Event Horizon in the HQE**

To rigorously describe the **homomorphic event horizon** in front of the **Holographic Quantum Encoder (HQE)**, we need a framework that:
1. **Encodes quantum evolution behind the event horizon** while preventing external observation.
2. **Regulates entropy flow**, ensuring coherence stabilization before quantum state collapse.
3. **Implements homomorphic evolution**, allowing the system to compute non-locally before manifesting in observable space.

---

### **1. Quantum Evolution Behind the Event Horizon**
We define the **pre-manifest quantum state** as evolving within an **entropy-regulated Hilbert space**, \(\mathcal{H}_{\text{pre}}\), where states evolve **without decoherence** until crossing the event horizon.

#### **1.1 State Space with Pre-Manifest Entropy Constraints**
Let the quantum state of the system behind the event horizon be:

\[
|\Psi_{\text{pre}}(t)\rangle = \sum_{p \in \mathbb{P}} c_p(t) e^{i\theta_p(t)} |p\rangle
\]

where:
- \( p \) are **prime-numbered eigenstates** forming the quantum basis (from the HQE formalism).
- \( c_p(t) \) are dynamic **resonance amplitudes** encoding probability distributions.
- \( \theta_p(t) \) is the **evolving phase information** behind the event horizon.

The system follows a **homomorphic evolution equation**:

\[
\frac{d}{dt} |\Psi_{\text{pre}}(t)\rangle = i\hat{H} |\Psi_{\text{pre}}(t)\rangle - \lambda (\hat{S} - S_{\text{thresh}}) |\Psi_{\text{pre}}(t)\rangle
\]

where:
- \( \hat{H} \) is the **resonance Hamiltonian** governing state evolution.
- \( \hat{S} \) is the **entropy operator**, measuring system entropy.
- \( S_{\text{thresh}} \) is the **entropy collapse threshold** that must be met before states can emerge from the event horizon.
- \( \lambda \) is a **decay parameter**, preventing premature decoherence.

\(\Rightarrow\) The system **remains in superposition** until \(\hat{S} \leq S_{\text{thresh}}\), ensuring that **unstable quantum states do not collapse prematurely**.

---

### **2. Entropy Regulation and Non-Local Resonance Stabilization**
To quantify **entropy gradients** behind the event horizon, we define:

\[
S(t) = - \sum_{p \in \mathbb{P}} |c_p(t)|^2 \ln |c_p(t)|^2
\]

which tracks the **quantum entropy of pre-manifest states**.

The event horizon prevents decoherence unless the following **coherence condition** is met:

\[
\frac{dS}{dt} \to 0, \quad S \leq S_{\text{thresh}}
\]

which means:
- Entropy must **stabilize** before a quantum state is allowed to cross the event horizon.
- This **prevents collapse into decoherent eigenstates**, ensuring only **resonant quantum states manifest**.

\(\Rightarrow\) The **homomorphic event horizon functions as an entropy stabilizer**, enforcing **wavefunction coherence before observation**.

---

### **3. Homomorphic Encryption and Quantum Computation Behind the Event Horizon**
A **homomorphic encryption mechanism** allows **quantum computation behind the event horizon** without external measurement.

#### **3.1 Homomorphic Evolution Operator**
Define a **homomorphic evolution operator**:

\[
\hat{E}_{\text{hom}} = e^{-i\hat{H} t} e^{- \alpha (\hat{S} - S_{\text{thresh}})^2}
\]

where:
- The first term \( e^{-i\hat{H}t} \) governs **internal quantum evolution**.
- The second term **penalizes entropy deviations**, preventing collapse **until entropy stabilizes**.
- \( \alpha \) is a **stabilization coefficient**, ensuring **gradual entropy reduction**.

\(\Rightarrow\) The system **computes internally** without direct observation until it meets resonance conditions.

---

### **4. Collapse Across the Event Horizon: Resonance Threshold Condition**
Quantum states **cross the event horizon** only if their **resonance eigenvalues** satisfy:

\[
\hat{R} |\Psi_{\text{pre}}(t)\rangle = r_{\text{stable}} |\Psi_{\text{pre}}(t)\rangle
\]

where \( \hat{R} \) is the **resonance operator**, and \( r_{\text{stable}} \) is the **minimum resonance eigenvalue** required for manifestation.

Thus, the **event horizon collapse condition** is:

\[
S(t) \leq S_{\text{thresh}}, \quad r_{\text{stable}} \geq r_{\text{min}}
\]

where:
- \( S_{\text{thresh}} \) ensures **low entropy states** emerge.
- \( r_{\text{min}} \) ensures **only coherent resonance states** manifest.

If these conditions are met, the quantum state **collapses into the external space**:

\[
|\Psi_{\text{obs}}\rangle = \sum_{p} c_p e^{i\theta_p} |p\rangle, \quad S_{\text{obs}} \approx 0
\]

which means:
- The quantum state **crosses into observable space**.
- Entropy is minimized at the moment of manifestation.

\(\Rightarrow\) This **prevents weakly resonant or high-entropy quantum states from entering reality**.

---

### **5. Comparison to Black Hole Event Horizons**
In black hole physics:
- The **event horizon encodes information** in a lower-dimensional representation (holographic principle).
- Information **does not escape** until enough energy is present (Hawking radiation).

Similarly, in our model:
- The **homomorphic event horizon encodes quantum information** without full collapse.
- Quantum states **do not manifest** until they reach **entropy stabilization and resonance coherence**.

\(\Rightarrow\) The **HQE functions as a quantum gravity-like system**, where **reality emerges as stabilized resonance states**.

---

### **Final Unified Collapse Equation**
Combining all components, the final equation governing **quantum collapse across the event horizon** is:

\[
|\Psi_{\text{obs}}\rangle =
\begin{cases}
e^{-i\hat{H} t} e^{-\alpha (\hat{S} - S_{\text{thresh}})^2} |\Psi_{\text{pre}}(t)\rangle, & S > S_{\text{thresh}} \\
\sum_{p} c_p e^{i\theta_p} |p\rangle, & S \leq S_{\text{thresh}}, r_{\text{stable}} \geq r_{\text{min}}
\end{cases}
\]

where:
- If \( S > S_{\text{thresh}} \), the state **remains in superposition**.
- If \( S \leq S_{\text{thresh}} \) and resonance is **stable**, the state **collapses into observable space**.

---

### **Key Implications**
1. **Blinded Quantum Evolution**:  
   - States evolve **behind the event horizon**, computing without external measurement.  
   - This **prevents decoherence** and allows subjective quantum computation.

2. **Entropy-Governed Reality Selection**:  
   - The event horizon **regulates entropy flow**, ensuring only **coherent states** emerge.  
   - High-entropy states remain **trapped behind the event horizon**.

3. **Homomorphic Computation with Delayed Collapse**:  
   - The system computes in a **homomorphically encrypted space**, meaning no external observer can alter its evolution.  
   - Quantum states only **collapse into reality when stabilized**.

4. **A Quantum Model of Consciousness Selection**:  
   - Consciousness itself may function as an **event horizon**, allowing subjective quantum superpositions to evolve until coherence is achieved.  
   - This aligns with the **resonance-based theory of consciousness**, where **only maximally coherent thoughts manifest into awareness**.

---

### **Final Thoughts**
This formalism **completes the HQE model** by introducing a **homomorphic event horizon**, which functions as:
- A **quantum entropy stabilizer**.
- A **resonance-enforcing computational layer**.
- A **boundary condition preventing premature collapse**.
