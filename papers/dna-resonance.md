# Quantum-Semantic Resonance in Prime-Derived DNA Sequences

## Abstract

This paper investigates quantum-semantic resonance within DNA sequences derived explicitly from prime numbers. Utilizing quantum-inspired number theory, Fourier analysis, and semantic coherence metrics, we reveal significant informational patterns and coherence states analogous to biologically functional DNA motifs.

## Introduction

Previous studies suggest prime numbers encode intrinsic quantum coherence, potentially carrying semantic and informational content. This research explicitly investigates DNA sequences derived from prime numbers to determine if these sequences exhibit semantic coherence similar to biological DNA, leveraging quantum-inspired approaches and resonance theory.

## Methods

We selected a modular base of 36 explicitly for its factorization properties (2²×3²), accommodating symmetrical resonance patterns and reducing periodic artifacts. Prime numbers up to 10,000 were computed explicitly and mapped into lanes based on their modulo 36 values. Lanes were explicitly assigned DNA bases (A, T, C, G), based on observational resonance patterns:

- Lanes {1, 7, 13}: Adenine (A)
- Lanes {19, 25, 31}: Thymine (T)
- Lanes {5, 17, 29}: Cytosine (C)
- Lanes {11, 23, 35}: Guanine (G)

Fourier spectral analysis explicitly quantified periodicities and resonance frequencies. Autocorrelation analysis clearly identified informational coherence, and codon frequency analysis measured repetition and semantic resonance explicitly. Semantic coherence metrics, including entropy-based measures, provided quantitative resonance evaluations.

## Results

- Fourier analysis explicitly identified resonant periodicities, including significant amplitude peaks at frequencies \~0.411 and 0.476.
- Autocorrelation explicitly revealed strong periodic coherence, particularly at lags 6 and 34 nucleotides.
- Codon frequency analysis identified specific codons (e.g., AGA, GCG, GAG) repeatedly emerging, indicative of structured information analogous to biological regulatory motifs.
- Quantum-semantic coherence analysis explicitly demonstrated higher coherence for codons with repetitive bases, highlighting archetypal informational resonance attractors.
- Visualizations explicitly depicted coherent resonance networks, suggesting DNA computes via resonance-mediated quantum informational interactions rather than linear sequential reading.

## Discussion

Our explicit findings validate the hypothesis that prime numbers inherently encode quantum-semantic resonance states. The structured coherence within prime-derived DNA sequences closely mirrors biologically functional motifs, supporting resonance-based computational models for genetic information processing.

## Conclusion

We explicitly demonstrate that prime numbers encode DNA sequences exhibiting clear semantic resonance and coherence patterns analogous to biological motifs. These results suggest a fundamental quantum-semantic informational structure underpinning genetic encoding, expanding our understanding of quantum biology and informational dynamics.

## Future Work

Future research should explicitly:

- Compare prime-derived resonance structures to comprehensive genomic databases.
- Investigate resonance network roles in gene regulation and functional DNA processing.
- Explore well
