## **2. Quantum AI for Resonance-Based Decision Making**

### **2.1 Adaptive Intelligence Using Prime Resonance Patterns**
Instead of relying on fixed logic trees or training datasets, we can develop AI systems that **dynamically modify themselves based on quantum resonance cycles**. This approach enables a new paradigm of adaptive intelligence that can reason and learn without traditional machine learning constraints.
