# Semantic Resonance Model Extensions: Implementation Plan

## Overview

Based on a comprehensive review of the codebase and requirements, this document outlines a phased approach to implement all three major extensions (Multimodal, Quantum Group Symmetries, and Extended Memory) in parallel while addressing the scaling limitations of the current model.

The implementation plan is divided into four phases, with parallel workstreams for each extension. This approach allows us to incrementally build and test each extension while ensuring they integrate properly with the core architecture.
