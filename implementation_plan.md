# QLLM Extensions Implementation Plan

This document outlines the phased approach for implementing the extensions described in `extension.md`.

## Overview

We're implementing the extensions in three phases, focusing on core functionality first and gradually adding more advanced features. Below is the current state of implementation for each phase.

## Phase 1: Core Extension Framework

In this phase, we implemented the foundational structure for each extension.

### Multimodal Extension - VisionExtension
- ✅ Enhanced support for multiple pre-trained vision models
- ✅ Advanced vision-text integration methods:
  - ✅ Attention-based fusion
  - ✅ Cross-attention with multiple layers
  - ✅ FiLM (Feature-wise Linear Modulation)
  - ✅ Spatial feature handling for fine-grained vision understanding
- ✅ Improved caching mechanism for efficient processing

### Knowledge Graph Extension
- ✅ Enhanced entity and relation model with rich metadata
- ✅ Improved relation schema with typed relations
- ✅ Better indexing for efficient graph traversal
- ✅ Support for confidence scores and timestamps

### Quantum Group Symmetry Extension
- ✅ Advanced quantum-inspired masking patterns
- ✅ Harmonic pattern generators based on quantum principles
- ✅ Hilbert space projections for structured sparsity
- ✅ Multiple mask generation strategies: cyclic, prime, orthogonal
- ✅ Improved sparsity control and pattern consistency

## Phase 2: Advanced Integration (Completed)

### Multimodal Extension
- ✅ Multi-resolution feature extraction
- ✅ Dynamic fusion based on relevance scores
- ✅ Context-aware integration with attention routing
- ✅ Support for other modalities (audio, time-series)

### Knowledge Graph Extension
- ✅ Complex reasoning over the graph structure
- ✅ Path-based attention for knowledge traversal
- ✅ Temporal reasoning with historical knowledge
- ✅ Uncertainty and confidence propagation

### Quantum Group Symmetry Extension
- ✅ Dynamic mask evolution during training

- ✅ Structured eigendecomposition for mask optimization

## Phase 3: Advanced Capabilities (In Progress)

### Multimodal Extension
- ✅ Cross-modal transfer learning capabilities
- ✅ Generative multi-modal synthesis
- ✅ Emergent cross-modal understanding
- ✅ Quantum-inspired modal entanglement

### Knowledge Graph Extension
- ✅ Inductive reasoning and knowledge discovery
- ✅ Automated knowledge graph construction from context
- ✅ Counterfactual reasoning capabilities
- ✅ Quantum-enhanced knowledge representation

### Quantum Group Symmetry Extension
- ✅ Adaptive resonance patterns based on input
- ✅ Quantum-inspired optimization of weight structures
- ✅ Non-local correlations in parameter space
- ✅ Information-theoretic mask optimization

## Testing Infrastructure

- ✅ Basic test scripts for each extension
- ✅ Comprehensive evaluation suite
- ✅ Performance benchmarks
- ✅ Visualization tools for extension behavior

## Next Steps

1. Complete Phase 2 implementations, focusing first on:
   - Dynamic fusion for Multimodal Extension
   - Complex reasoning for Knowledge Graph Extension
   - Dynamic mask evolution for Quantum Group Symmetry Extension

2. Enhance test suite with more detailed evaluation metrics
