In the context of our model, it's a mechanism that allows for enhanced pattern recognition and information processing by aligning computational elements using prime number-based patterns."

Then, we process batches of text through the model, comparing outputs to expected targets. The error is back-propagated through the network, but instead of uniform updates, we apply quantum resonance adjustments that maintain the prime-based sparse structures. This continues for multiple epochs until convergence."
